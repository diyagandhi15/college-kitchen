1) Project Description:
   This project aims to develop a web application catering to college students, offering recipe suggestions based on available ingredients and facilitating playlist creation for cooking sessions. Using the Spoonacular API will provide recipe recommendations, and the Spotify API will correlate playlists with cooking time. The front-end will be built using React.js, and Python for the back-end. The app will utilize SQLite for storing user recipes, ingredient lists, and playlist preferences, and Google OAuth for secure authentication using school email addresses. If we have time we will implement a shared pantry feature for collaborative meal planning and dinner parties.

2) Product Requirements:
Goal: Create a user-friendly web application that suggests recipes and creates cooking playlists.
Non-Goal:
Non-functional Requirement 1: Security
Implement OAuth authentication for Spotify login.
Implement Google OAuth for secure authentication using college email addresses.
Non-functional Requirement 2: Repeatability
 Previous searches and their results will be stored locally
Certain Recipes will have the same playlist every time
